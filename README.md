In this repository we develop an anlytics code which enable us to find and develop a correlation between Lung Cancer and Air Quality. We are working with the "Air Quality-Lung Cancer Data" and at the end of this project hope to build a predictive approach to our dataset.

## Introduction:
### Introduction to dataset:
We will begin by introducing the dataset used. It is the "Air Quality-Lung Cancer Data" (Unique Identifier: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HMOEJO). The datsaet includes Population-based lung cancer incidence rates for the period 2010-2014 from National Cancer Institute state cancer profiles (Schwartz et al. 1996).This national county-level database of cancer data is collected by state public health surveillance systems. The domain specific county level environmental quality index (EQI) data for the period 2000-2005 were abstracted from United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) profile.

### Metadata:
1. FIPS_code: Federal Information Processing Standards now known as Federal Information Processing Series, are numeric codes assigned by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). US states are identified by a 2-digit number, while US counties are identified by a 6-4 digit number.
2. County: County name
3. State: State name
4. Lung Cancer: 
5. PM2.5: PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers.
6. Status Variable: 
7. Land_EQI: An environmental quality index (EQI) for all counties in the U.S. was developed, a comprehensive estimate of environmental quality for understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and human health. Specific for LAND.
8. Sociod_EQI: Specifics for Socio
